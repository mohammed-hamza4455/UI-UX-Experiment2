## 🧩 Algorithm / Approach  

1. **Analysis of Web Layout**  
   - Sidebar navigation, horizontal statistics cards, user table.  

2. **Application of Gestalt Principles**  
   - **Proximity**: Grouped related stats into cards.  
   - **Similarity**: Used consistent typography and iconography.  
   - **Continuity**: Natural flow from header → welcome → stats → users → CTA.  
   - **Closure**: Used cards/containers for scannability.  
   - **Figure-Ground**: Maintained strong contrast.  

3. **Mobile Layout Conversion**  
   - Header with **hamburger menu + logo**.  
   - Green **welcome banner**.  
   - Vertical **stacked statistic cards**.  
   - User table → **individual user cards**.  
   - Sticky yellow **“+ Create User” button** at bottom.  

4. **Branding & Logo (Canva)**  
   - Logo designed with a modern, flat style.  
   - **Color Palette**: Black (#000), Yellow (#FFD60A), White (#FFF).  
   - **Typography**: Clean sans-serif.
